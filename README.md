# sql-challenge
In this challenge we create a database schema with 6 different tables :
-> departments
-> employees
-> dep_emp
-> dept_manager
-> salaries
-> titles

First and ERD is create to generate relationships between the tables using http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com
Data is imported into the tables
8 different views are created to query data as desired
